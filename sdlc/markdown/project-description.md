# Airline Booking and Management System Project Description

An airline is a complex business that requires customer-facing 
services as well sophisticated internal tools and business logic in order
to succeed. An airline website allows customers to view flights and 
purchase a ticket for upcoming trips. From an operational perspective, 
airlines also need a website to view and manage their aircraft and any
associated information, such as their upcoming trips and maintenance schedule.

This project aims to provide a product that covers these two domains,
namely flight booking and aircraft and flight management.
From a single website customers are able to browse upcoming, in-flight,
and completed flights. From the same website, administrator accounts
are able to view the status of aircraft. In the background, the system's
database continuously and periodically assigns aircraft to upcoming flights 
and updates the status of flights and aircraft.

This solution is meant to be architecturally simple where feasible and 
is deployed on a single host. It implements a basic client-server-database 
architecture.
